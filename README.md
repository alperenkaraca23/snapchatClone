# snapchatClone

<li> In this project, I made an application by cloning the most basic functions of the Snapchat application. </li>
<li> This application I made consists of a Sign in page, an upload page, a feed page, settings and pages where we can see the snaps shared by a user as an image slider. </li>
<li> Within the scope of this application, I used Firebase with its wider features. Apart from that, I used Swift Package Manager. I used it in my project by integrating imageslider into my project. I used the Singleton structure.  </li>
<li> I first started making my application by creating models and sign in page. I did the authorization process with Firebase. </li>
<li> After doing this I designed a Cell for the Feed. I chose to have username and snap in this cell. </li>
<li> Then I designed the Feed section. Here I wrote the function that will allow me to retrieve data from Firebase. And I also added the function that will allow me to pull user information. </li>
<li> I continued by designing SnapVc. I added imageSlider here. This way, all snaps added by a user can be viewed as a single snap. I completed this page by making minor adjustments such as the page indicator colors. And I also added a label so that people can see the time left for the snap to be removed. </li>

<li> Afterwards, I made an upload page to share snaps. </li>
<li> Finally, I completed my application by creating a settings page that includes a logout button. </li>
